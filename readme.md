(Alpha) Speedrunning Map Path Tool
=

**Warning: This is a super early version of the tool.  It's going to break, it's going to have bugs.**

**Note: The current use case is targeted at the Hollow Knight Community, but there is no reason this can't eventually be used for any game that has a 2D map.**

Overview
==
This tool is designed to allow the speed running community to take a map for a game, and then quickly and easily draw out routes, make notes, etc in a dynamic fashion.  Short term, these routes will be stored locally in the browser, but exportable to share.  Depending on the interest, backend cloud storage might be added down the line.
